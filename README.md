The following Git repository is for the project titled "Machine learning and natural language processing models to predict the extent of food processing". The code files have been added, since the same code files were used for various set of nutrients. Only set of the files have been added in the Code Files directory. Further, data has been added in the data folder.
The code files for each model are named with the model's name. 
For generating the textual embeddings, the scripts are named with the respective LLM.
Finally, certain utility scripts have been added that fulfil the purpose of training the model, generating the ROC & AUPRC Curves. These scripts were also updated for the various experiments done but the majority of the scripts remain unchanged.
